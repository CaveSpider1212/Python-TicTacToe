# Python-TicTacToe
Simple Tic-tac-toe game made with the tkinter module in Python

- This game has the same usual tic-tac-toe rules and is made for playing with 2 people
- The game should work fine, and the GUI window can be expanded if there are any issues with the button sizes (but the buttons still stay the same size).
